Non-procedural-programming semester project.

Project Description:

Finding a minimum spanning tree of a given graph
in Haskell using Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.
The program takes inputs:
- file containing graph description (adjacency list)
- flag indicating which algorithm to use. -p for Prim's and -k for Kruskal's

The program will output the edges of the minimum
spanning tree and the weight of the tree.
